# Day 1 Notes – QA Testing

## 1 What is Testing?
- Software Testing is the process of checking whether the software works as expected, has no defects, meets requirements, and gives a smooth user experience.

## Simple Definition
- ➡ Testing is finding whether the software is correct, complete, and quality before release.

## Why testing?
- To find bugs early
- To ensure working features
- To improve product quality
- To prevent customer issues
- To reduce cost of fixing bugs later

## ✔ 2. SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle

- SDLC is the process followed by developers to build software from start to finish.

## SDLC Phases

1. Requirement Gathering
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Development (Coding)
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

- ➡ Developers mainly work from Design → Development.
- ➡ Testers join from Requirement → Testing.

## ✔ 3. STLC – Software Testing Life Cycle

- STLC is the process followed by testers to test the software in a structured way.

## STLC Phases

1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Case Design
4. Environment Setup
5. Test Execution
6. Defect Logging & Tracking
7. Test Cycle Closure

- ➡ STLC starts as soon as requirements come.

## 📝 SDLC vs STLC (Notes)
1. SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

- Focuses on development of software.
- Involves requirement → analysis → design → coding → testing → deployment.
- Goal: Build and deliver working software.
- Developers play the major role.
- Testing is one phase inside SDLC.

2. STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
- Focuses only on testing activities.
- Involves requirement analysis → test planning → test case creation → test execution → closure.
- Goal: Ensure quality and find defects.
- Testers play the major role.
- Testing is the entire process here.


## SDLC vs STLC
| SDLC | STLC |
|------|------|
| End-to-end software development cycle | End-to-end testing cycle |
| Includes development and testing | Only testing-related tasks |
| Developers + Testers involved | Primarily Testers involved |
| Output = Working Software | Output = Quality Report + Test Results |
