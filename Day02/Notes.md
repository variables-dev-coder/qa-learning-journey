# ✅ Day 2 – Software Testing (QA) Notes

## 1️⃣ Verification vs Validation

| Aspect     | Verification                           | Validation                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Are we building the product **right**? | Are we building the **right product**? |
| Focus      | Process-oriented                       | Product-oriented                       |
| Goal       | Ensure software follows specs          | Ensure software meets user needs       |
| When       | During development                     | After development / during testing     |
| Done by    | Testers, QA team                       | Testers, QA team, sometimes Users      |
| Example    | Review, walkthrough, inspection        | Functional testing, UAT                |
| Question   | “Did we follow the process?”           | “Does it work as intended?”            |
- ✅ Expert Tip: Verification is static, Validation is dynamic.

## 2️⃣ QA vs QC

| Aspect         | QA (Quality Assurance)         | QC (Quality Control)                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Definition     | Process to **prevent defects** | Process to **identify defects**        |
| Focus          | Process improvement            | Product quality                        |
| Type           | Preventive                     | Detective                              |
| Activities     | Audits, process check, reviews | Testing, defect detection              |
| Responsibility | QA team                        | QC team / Testers                      |
| Timing         | Throughout SDLC                | After product is developed             |
| Goal           | Ensure quality in process      | Ensure quality in product              |
| Example        | ISO process checks, standards  | Functional testing, regression testing |
- ✅ Expert Tip: QA is process-focused, QC is product-focused.

## 3️⃣ Test Levels
- Test levels describe when testing is performed in SDLC:

- 1. Unit Testing – Tests individual modules (done by dev/tester).
- 2. Integration Testing – Tests combined modules interaction.
- 3. System Testing – Tests complete end-to-end system.
- 4. Acceptance Testing – Tests if system meets user requirements (UAT).

# 10 Key Differences – QA & QC, Verification & Validation

1. Verification is static; Validation is dynamic.
2. Verification ensures process correctness; Validation ensures product correctness.
3. QA prevents defects; QC detects defects.
4. QA is process-focused; QC is product-focused.
5. Verification done during development; Validation done after development.
6. QA involves process audits; QC involves testing activities.
7. QA responsibility: QA team; QC responsibility: Testers.
8. QA improves process; QC ensures quality in software.
9. Verification asks "Did we do it right?"; Validation asks "Did we build the right thing?"
10. QA is preventive; QC is detective.
